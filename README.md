Dress Up Game
==========================

A little secret Christmas project for the staff of The Whitepepper. 

This code is an update of [Ninique's Dollmaker script](https://github.com/ninique/Dollmaker-Script). I've modified it to work with touch devices using Touchpunch, made the template responsive, and updated methods to work with jQuery 1.7.2 and jQuery UI 1.8.18. 

I've also attempted to add a screenshot function using HTML2Canvas (see branch html2canvas-experiments) but am unable to get it to limit the dimensions of a single div at this point in time.
